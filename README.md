# ZL3TILProject

This repository contains support files for two presentations made to the Marlborough NZART in July and August 2019.

The presentations covered the tools and methods used to layout printed circuit boards with an emphasis on using SMD components, followed by ways of manufacturing a board, and finally the assembly of a board.

The example used to illustrate the topic is the function generator described in this blog article. http://www.technoblogy.com/show?2FCL 

The first files to refer to are the speaking notes pt1 and 2.  These are the notes for the presentation.  They are not intended to be a tutorial, but rather a curated  set of links to the excellent online resources available for the topic.

Included in the repository are copies of the parts libraries provided by Adafruit and Sparkfun.  These were included for convenience during the presentation.  You are best advised to download up to date copies from these companiesâ€™ websites, and also the Seeed open parts library from the Seeed website.
